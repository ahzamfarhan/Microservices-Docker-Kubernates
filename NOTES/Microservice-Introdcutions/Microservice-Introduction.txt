	Microservices are bunch independence of applications that work independently and has their own database. These microservices communicates with client as well as with each other via API gateway. They are resilient, fault tolarance and are deployed, scaled independently. These microservies are not tied to any specific language and techstack. Each microservice can be developed using different tech stack. Tracing and debugging are difficult for microservices because they are not present in one place as module of single monlith application but there are tools availabe for tracing and debugging such as Zipkkin and slueth. Clients calls microservices using name rather than static host and port same is true when these microservices each other and it is very useful because microserviecs can deployed in cloud and cloud providers can be changed, load balancing is easy because end the day client including microservices call other microservice using name not static host and port. Microservices code base can be mono-repo or poly-repo. When soruce code of all microservices are stored in same repo then it is called mono-repo whereas when each microservice soruce code is stored in separate repo then it is called poly-repo. The continout deployment and intergration which is CD/CI is easy in case of poly repo whereas in case of mono repo it is complext because when we want to execlude some of microservices to be deployed but other are not then we have to write additional scripts
	In case of Mono repo each of microservices are stored in structure folders. Each microservice source code is stored in a folder/directory.
